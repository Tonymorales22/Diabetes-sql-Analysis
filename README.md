data cleaning, clinical KPI generation, and exploratory analysis. The dataset is widely
used in the fields of clinical analytics and machine learning due to its simplicity and 
well-structured medical features.

from female patients of Pima heritage, along with a binary outcome indicating the 
presence or absence of diabetes.

This dataset is intended for educational and research purposes and contains no personally 
identifiable information (PII).
